from datetime import date                                                    Imports the date module of datetime

# Variables

today = date.today()                                                         Makes a variable to find what the day is

# Start

# Asking for user input:
while True:                                                                  Loops the code asking for user input
    try:
        birth_year = int(input('What is your birth year? '))                 Asks the user for input 
        if birth_year > year:                                                Seeing if the given year is in the future
            print("Your birth year cannot be in the future.")                Telling the user their birth year can't be in the future
            continue                                                         Continuing in the loop
        elif birth_year < 1900:                                              Seeing if the year is too far back
            print("Your birth year is too far in the past.")                 Telling the user their birth year can't be too long ago
            continue                                                         Continuing in the loop

    except ValueError:                                                       If the user has inputted stuff not filtered earlier, that's invalid this stops them
        print("Please enter a valid birth year.")                            Gives a message saying that they can't put invalid input in

# Doing the math:
age = year - birth_year                                                      Does self explanitory math

# Printing results
if age == 0:                                                                 Tests if the person is a newborn, so that it can use else
    print("You are 0 years old today! Amazingly large number!")              Does stand up comedy
else:                                                                        If this person is not a new born, then continue
    print(f"You are {age} years old today!")                                 Prints out the users age
